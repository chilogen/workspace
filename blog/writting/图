# 图的概念

* ***导出子图---induced subgraphs***
```
Formally, let G = (V, E) be any graph, and let S ⊂ V be any subset of vertices of G.
Then the induced subgraph G[S] is the graph whose vertex set is S and whose edge set
 consists of all of the edges in E that have both endpoints in S---------(wikipedia)
```
导出子图是由原图中的一个**点子集V** 和所有**两个端点都是V中点的边集E**构成的子图

* **导出路径---induced path**
```
In the mathematical area of graph theory, an induced path in an undirected graph G is
a path that is an induced subgraph of G. That is, it is a sequence of vertices in G
such that each two adjacent vertices in the sequence are connected by an edge in G,
and each two nonadjacent vertices in the sequence are not connected by any edge in G.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------  -(wikipedia)
```
在图G中的一条导出路径上任意两个相连点都由G中的一条边相连，任意两个不相连点都没有任一条  
G中的边将它们相连。

* **导出匹配----induced matching**
```
A matching in a graph is a set of edges, no two of which
meet a common vertex. An induced matching M in a graph G is
a matching where no two edges of M are joined by an edge of G. 
```
一个匹配是指一个图G的一个边集，边集中任意两条边都没有公共顶点，  
导出匹配也是是图G中一个边集，除了满足匹配的性质外，任意两条边都  
没有一条G中的边将它们直接相连
